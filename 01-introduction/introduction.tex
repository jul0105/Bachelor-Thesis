\section{Problematic}


% ------ 06 A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering -------------
% Classical auth methods :

% traditional way to auth
% hash user's password and store them in a database
% connection between client and server should be secured (HTTPS, TLS)
% precomputed hash attack (raimbow tables)
% many way to do it and lot's of improvment 
    % using memory-hard password hashing function (scrypt, Argon2, etc..) (KDF ?)
    % using salt
    % using pepper
% all these approach have the same weakness:

% When the user wants to login, he has to send its cleartext password to the server in order for the server to authenticate the user.
% "This requirement can lead to disaster if your server is ever persistently compromised or if your developers make a simple mistake"



% PAKE at the rescue :

% (PAKE "provide protection for the client's password")
% PAKE allow to .........

% "many people dont want to run a key exchange protocol. They just want to verify that a user knows a password."
% "The great thing about PAKE is that the simpler “login only” use-case is easy to achieve. If I have a standard PAKE protocol that allows a client and server to agree on a shared key K if (and only if) the client knows the right password, then all we need add is a simple check that both parties have arrived at the same key."



% Why PAKE have almost no adoption :

% PAKE provides "an obvious security benefit compared to the naive approach we use to log into servers today." 
% PAKE are old. "they have been known since 1992"

% "Almost no adoption"
% "it's much easier to put a password form onto a web page than it is to do dancy crypto in the browser"
% But "even native app rarely implement PAKE for their logins"

% patents ("though most of these are expired now")
% "Lack of good PAKE implementations in useful languages". "Make them a hassle to use"


% One of the exception: SRP
% - "most wiidely-deployed PAKE protocol in the world"
% - TLS ciphersuite, implemented in OpenSSL
% - used extensively in iCloud Key Vault ("make SRP one of the most widely used cryptographic protocols in the world, so vast is the number of devices that Apple ships. So this is nothing to sneer at")
% - "SRP isn't the best PAKE we can deploy"

% SRP TLDR:
% - .........

% The new generation: OPAQUE



% ----- 02 Cloudflare blog post --------
% Why passwords sucks :

% - "Passwords are a problem"
% - "hard to remember and manage"
% - solved with password manager, but the "greater underlying problem" is not here
% - The problem is: "A password that leaves your possession is guaranteed to sacriface security, no matter its complexity or how hard it may be to guess."
% - "any direct use of a password, today, means that the password must be handled in the clear"

% - "but my password is transmitted securely over HTTPS"
% - "but I know the server stores my password in hashed form" (lot of faith in the server
% - Anyway, the password is processed in cleartext
% - accidental logging or caching !!!
% - Hardware vulnerability. "password reside in memory". "Transmitted over a shared bus to the CPU". "Attack vectors far less likely but no less severe" (Spectre, Meltdown).
% - "Ideally, servers should never see a plaintext password at all"



% Remove password :
% - "get rid of passwords altogether"
% - "Password-based authen is annoying"
% - "passwords are hard to remember, tedious to type, and notoriously insecure"

% - "New stadards are emerging and growing mature"
% - "Initiatives to reduce password are promising"
% - "For example, WebAuthn: web auth based on public key cryptography using hardware (or SW) tokens."

% - "But passwords are so ubiquitous that it will take a long time to agree on a supplant passwords with new standards and technology"
% - "whether their persistence is due to ease of implementation, familiarity to users, or simple ubiquity on the web and elsewhere."

% - "We'd like to make password-based auth as secure as possible while they persist."
% - For the moment, "enable a password to be useful without it ever leaving your possession"




% symmetric PAKE :

% proposed by Bellovin and Merrit in 1992: Bellovin, S. M., and Merritt, M. “Encrypted key exchange: Password-based protocols secure against dictionary attacks.” In Proc. IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy (Oakland, May 1992), pp. 72–84.

% - " initial motivation of allowing password-authentication without the possibility of dictionary attacks based on data transmitted over an insecure channel"
% - "symmetric PAKE is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties who share only a password to establish a strong shared secret key"
% "goals of PAKE are :"
%   1. "The secret keys will match if the passwords match, and appear random otherwise."
%   2. "Participants do not need to trust third parties (in particular, no Public Key Infrastructure),"
%   3. "The resulting secret key is not learned by anyone not participating in the protocol - including those who know the password."
%   4. "The protocol does not reveal either parties’ password to each other (unless the passwords match), or to eavesdroppers."

% - "In sum, the only way to successfully attack the protocol is to guess the password correctly while participating in the protocol"

% - In this setup, PAKE is even worse than using a classical auth method because the user's password must be stored as cleartext in the server



% asymmetric PAKE (aPAKE) :

% "only the client knows the password, and the server knows a hashed password"
% "has the 4 properties of PAKE plus one more:"
%   5. " An attacker who steals password data stored on the server must perform a dictionary attack to retrieve the password."
% - "The issue with most existing aPAKE protocols, however, is that they do not allow for a salted hash (or if they do, they require that salt to be transmitted to the user, which means the attacker has access to the salt beforehand and can begin computing a rainbow table for the user before stealing any data (SRP))."


% OPAQUE :
% - "OPAQUE is the first aPAKE protocol with a formal security proof that has this property: it allows for a completely secret salt."
