\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Problematic}

% Classical auth methods :

% traditional way to auth
% hash user's password and store them in a database
% many way to do it and lot's of improvment 
    % using memory-hard password hashing function (scrypt, Argon2, etc..) (KDF ?)
    % using salt
    % using pepper
% all these approach have the same weakness:

% When the user wants to login, he has to send its cleartext password to the server in order for the server to authenticate the user.
% "This requirement can lead to disaster if your server is ever persistently compromised or if your developers make a simple mistake"



% PAKE at the rescue :

% (PAKE "provide protection for the client's password")
% PAKE allow to .........

% "many people dont want to run a key exchange protocol. They just want to verify that a user knows a password."
% "The great thing about PAKE is that the simpler “login only” use-case is easy to achieve. If I have a standard PAKE protocol that allows a client and server to agree on a shared key K if (and only if) the client knows the right password, then all we need add is a simple check that both parties have arrived at the same key."



% Why PAKE have almost no adoption :

% PAKE provides "an obvious security benefit compared to the naive approach we use to log into servers today." 
% PAKE are old. "they have been known since 1992"

% "Almost no adoption"
% "it's much easier to put a password form onto a web page than it is to do dancy crypto in the browser"
% But "even native app rarely implement PAKE for their logins"

% patents ("though most of these are expired now")
% "Lack of good PAKE implementations in useful languages". "Make them a hassle to use"


% One of the exception: SRP
% - "most wiidely-deployed PAKE protocol in the world"
% - TLS ciphersuite, implemented in OpenSSL
% - used extensively in iCloud Key Vault ("make SRP one of the most widely used cryptographic protocols in the world, so vast is the number of devices that Apple ships. So this is nothing to sneer at")
% - "SRP isn't the best PAKE we can deploy"

% SRP TLDR:
% -

% The new generation: OPAQUE
